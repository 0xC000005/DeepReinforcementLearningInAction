# DeepReinforcementLearningInAction
Code from the Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action book from Manning, Inc

The code snippets, listings, and projects are all embedded in Jupyter Notebooks
organized by chapter. Visit [http://jupyter.org/install](http://jupyter.org/install) for
instructions on installing Jupyter Notebooks.

In order to run many of the projects, you'll need at least the [http://www.numpy.org/](NumPy) library
and [http://pytorch.org/](PyTorch).

If you experience any issues running the examples, please file an issue.
